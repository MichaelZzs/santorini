Michael:
I worked on interface, heuristic player, UML diagrams, and writeup.
Throughout this project, it was really nice working with Allen since he helped me debug at times when I did need help, and we came up together of ideas of how to implement the interface and what design patterns to implement. Ultimately, pair programming definitely helped with the coding process as discussing with a partner allowed me to see the pros and cons of some of my logic, such as the interface or the design patterns. Apart from working on the general interface, I was also able to implement the heuristic player, draw the UML diagram, and complete the write up for all of the design patterns. I had a fun time, and hope to do another pair programming assignment in the future. I believe we contributed more or less equally to the final assignment.
