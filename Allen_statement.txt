Allen:
I worked on interface, human player, random player, and design patterns.
I had a great time working with Michael. We efficiently divided which parts of the assignment we would work on, and worked closely
throughout the assignment to catch any bugs and talk about implementation details. Specifically, we talked about what design patterns
would best fit our design of the program, and determined that Iterator, Strategy, Memento, and Command patterns would fit the best. I 
learned a lot about implementing design patterns, "Pythonic" code, and working with a partner.
